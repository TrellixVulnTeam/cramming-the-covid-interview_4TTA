Array List (Dynamic Array)
===
From [Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array)

>In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), 
>a dynamic array, growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, 
>or array list is a [random access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access), 
>variable-size list [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) that 
>allows elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard 
>libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages. Dynamic arrays 
>overcome a limit of static arrays, which have a fixed capacity that needs 
>to be specified at allocation.
 
>A dynamic array is not the same thing as a 
>[dynamically allocated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation) array, 
>which is an [array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) whose size is fixed when the array is allocated, although a 
>dynamic array may use such a fixed-size array as a back end.[1]
