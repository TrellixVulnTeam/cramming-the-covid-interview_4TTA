Breadth-first search 
===
From [Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

> Breadth-first search (BFS) is an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) for traversing 
>or searching [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure) or 
>[graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)) data structures. 
>It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to 
>as a 'search key'[1]), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth 
>prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
  
> It uses the opposite strategy of [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), 
>which instead explores the node branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and 
>expand other nodes.[2]
