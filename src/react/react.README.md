# React (web framework)

From [Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)>)

> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source), [front end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end),
> [JavaScript library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library) for building [user interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interfaces)
> or UI components.
> It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers
> and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development
> of [single-page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned
> with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications
> usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management
> and routing.[7][8] Redux[9] and React Router[10] are respective
> examples of such libraries.
