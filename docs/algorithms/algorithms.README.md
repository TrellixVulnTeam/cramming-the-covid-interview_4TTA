Algorithm

From [Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

>In [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) and 
>[computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), 
>an algorithm is a finite sequence of [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined), 
>computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
>Algorithms are always [unambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unambiguous) and are used as 
>specifications for performing [calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculation), 
>[data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing), 
>[automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), and other tasks.

>As an [effective method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method), an algorithm can be 
>expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language 
>for calculating a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)). 
>Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [empty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string)),
> the instructions describe a [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) that, when 
>[executed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)), proceeds through a finite
>number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating 
>at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily 
>[deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic); some algorithms, 
>known as randomized [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithms), incorporate random input.

Design
===
> One of the most important aspects of algorithm design lies in the creation of algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [Big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation).

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:

1. Problem definition
1. Development of a model
1. Specification of the algorithm
1. Designing an algorithm
1. Checking the correctness of the algorithm
1. Analysis of algorithm
1. Implementation of algorithm
1. Program testing
1. Documentation preparation
