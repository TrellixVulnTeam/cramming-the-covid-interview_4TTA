Linked List
===
From [Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)


> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a linked list is a linear collection of 
>data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element 
>[points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) to the next. It is a 
>[data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) consisting of a collection of [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)) which 
>together represent a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence). In its most basic form, each node 
>contains: [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)), and a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)) (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. 
>This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence 
>during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or 
>removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear 
>(and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. [Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) have better 
>cache locality compared to linked lists.
